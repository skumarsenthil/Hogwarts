    <p style = "font-family:'Lucida Calligraphy'">It's been 16 years since we have met. There are times that i have been jealous of you and also thought that I can't be friends with such a person now you are one of my favourite person and yeah its true not joking. I have always wondered that how can one be so talented and you were one of an inspiration growing up. I am going to share a short story here, but I doubt that you will remember.After all you forgot the competiotion that only we both attended, this is soething hard to remember. Kamarajar School hosts competition eyery year for his birthday. You were participating in the elocution competion. I was in the Essay writing competition sitting 2 classes away. In the middle of the whole writing class was stunned, We could hear some bold voice speaking but only I could recognize it. 
	The invigilator jokingly said to everyone "Damn that kid is going to win" and I was like noway someone is going to say like that about me. 
	I would go like Ok "She could top the exam, dance, play, give a speech, draw, act. Is there anything that she could'nt do?". You always have it in you.
	So I would like to thank you by using this oppurtunity to motivating my younger self.
